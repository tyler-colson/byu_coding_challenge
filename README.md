A lot of my time was taken getting things set up (the api, nuxt, etc) and trying to learn how to use the different technologies. I don't have experience with any javascript framework but it was cool to see the power of one. I decided to work on the front-end first by getting the API working and trying to connect it to my web application. I was able to display the title, image, and popularity score and add a little styling to it. I ran out of time and wasn't able to get the back-end setup to call the API when I called the back-end from my web application. 

I was also unable to get the search bar to work. I tried a few different things like creating a function that would be called when the user clicks the search button, store the value of the input in a variable, and then call the search api again with the new input included. But I was having a hard time getting the value of the input without using "document" and also updating the html with all of the movies.

Moving forward with future versions of the application, I would first finish the project (front-end and back-end) but then I think it would be cool to add filters where the user could filter by genre, year, director, etc.

I would also add a machine learning pipeline where users could "favorite movies" or select movies they have already watched, and then the ML pipeline would be able to suggest other movies to that the user that it "thinks" they would enjoy.

I also think it would be cool to be able to click on an individual movie and the web application would take you to a different page and show more details about the movie.
